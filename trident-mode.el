;; Version: 0.9.1
;; Keywords: languages, lisp, processes, tools
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24") (slime "20130526") (skewer-mode "1.5.0") (dash "1.0.3"))

;;; Commentary:

;; This is an Emacs minor mode and collection of commands for working with
;; Parenscript code in SLIME and sending it to the browser via Skewer. The goal
;; is to create an environment for hacking Parenscript which fits as naturally
;; as possible into the Lisp style of interactive development.

;; ** Installation

;; Trident is available on MELPA, meaning a simple =M-x package-install RET
;; trident-mode RET= will install both it and its dependencies.

;; To enable MELPA, if you haven't already, add something like the following to
;; your Emacs configuration:

;;   (require 'package)
;;   (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;                '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
;;   (package-initialize)

;; The dependencies that will be installed are:
;;   - SLIME
;;   - Skewer
;;   - dash.el

;; Trident also requires a Common Lisp implementation and Parenscript.
;; Quicklisp is the best way to install Parenscript.

;; ** Setup

;; To enable trident-mode in a SLIME buffer: M-x trident-mode.

;; To have lisp-mode, slime-mode, and trident-mode all enable automatically for
;; any file with an extension of ".paren":

;;   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons "\\.paren\\'" 'lisp-mode))
;;   (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook
;;             #'(lambda ()
;;                 (when (and buffer-file-name
;;                            (string-match-p "\\.paren\\>" buffer-file-name))
;;                   (unless (slime-connected-p)
;;                     (save-excursion (slime)))
;;                   (trident-mode +1))))

;; Parenscript must be loaded in your Common Lisp image, and you'll probably
;; also want to import its symbols:

;;   (ql:quickload :parenscript)
;;   (use-package :parenscript)

;; With the above taken care of it's time to skewer the browser. See Skewer's
;; README for detailed information on the multiple ways you can connect to a
;; site - including sites on servers you don't control.

;; The fastest way to simply try things out is to run M-x run-skewer. Skewer
;; will load an empty page in your browser and connect to it. You can
;; immediately begin using Trident's evaluation commands (described below); to
;; additionally open a JavaScript REPL you can run M-x skewer-repl.

;; ** Commands

;; *** Code expansion commands

;; These commands generate JavaScript from the Parenscript code and display it
;; but don't send it to the browser for evaluation:

;;    - trident-expand-sexp
;;    - trident-expand-last-expression
;;    - trident-expand-defun
;;    - trident-expand-region
;;    - trident-expand-buffer
;;    - trident-expand-dwim

;; From within an expansion buffer you can press e to send the JavaScript to
;; the browser, w to copy it to the kill ring, s to save it to a file (you'll
;; be prompted for the destination) or q to dismiss the buffer. The copy
;; command, w, acts on the region if it's active or the entire buffer
;; otherwise.

;; Additionally, you can use M-x trident-compile-buffer-to-file to expand the
;; current buffer and save the generated code directly to a file.

;; *** Code evaluation commands

;; These commands first compile the Parenscript code to JavaScript and then
;; immediately send to it the browser to be evaluated:

;;    - trident-eval-sexp
;;    - trident-eval-last-expression
;;    - trident-eval-defun
;;    - trident-eval-region
;;    - trident-eval-buffer
;;    - trident-eval-dwim

;; ** Key bindings

;; The traditional set of code evaluation key bindings is a poor fit for
;; Trident,since they would shadow SLIME's equivalent commands and that's
;; probably not what you want. That leaves us without a clear convention to
;; follow, so by default we don't establish any key bindings at all. However,
;; the function trident-add-keys-with-prefix will add two-key key bindings for
;; all commands behind a prefix of your choice.

;; For example: (trident-add-keys-with-prefix "C-c C-e"). The key sequence for
;; trident-eval-region is "e r", so it's now bound to "C-c" "C-e er"

;; The full list of key bindings trident-add-keys-with-prefix will establish
;; is:

;;    - "e RET" -- trident-eval-sexp
;;    - "e e" -- trident-eval-last-expression
;;    - "e d" -- trident-eval-defun
;;    - "e r" -- trident-eval-region
;;    - "e b" -- trident-eval-buffer
;;    - "e SPC" -- trident-eval-dwim
;;    - "x RET" -- trident-expand-sexp
;;    - "x e" -- trident-expand-last-expression
;;    - "x d" -- trident-expand-defun
;;    - "x r" -- trident-expand-region
;;    - "x b" -- trident-expand-buffer
;;    - "x SPC" -- trident-expand-dwim

;; Evaluation commands begin with an "e", expansion commands with "x". The
;; second letter is generally mnemonic but not always. The -sexp commands use
;; RET in correspondence to slime-expand-1, and the -dwim commands use the
;; space bar because it's easy and comfortable to hit.

;; Please consider these keys provisional, and let me know if you have any
;; ideas for improving the arrangement.

;; If you really want to shadow SLIME's key bindings in buffers where
;; trident-mode is active you could do something like this:

;;   (defun steal-slime-keys-for-trident! ()
;;     ;; Don't affect all SLIME buffers, just where invoked
;;     (make-local-variable 'slime-mode-map)
;;     (let ((map slime-mode-map))
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-x C-e") nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-r") nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-M-x")   nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-k") nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-m") nil))
;;     (let ((map trident-mode-map))
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-x C-e") 'trident-eval-last-expression)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-r") 'trident-eval-region)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-M-x")   'trident-eval-defun)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-k") 'trident-eval-buffer)
;;       (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-m") 'trident-expand-sexp)))
;;
;;   (add-hook 'trident-mode-hook 'steal-slime-keys-for-trident!)

;; ** Other amenities

;; slime-selector is a great feature and Trident can optionally integrate with
;; it. If you call trident-add-slime-selector-methods, two entries related to
;; trident-mode will be added. One, invoked with p, will take you to the most
;; recently visited buffer where trident-mode is active (excluding buffers
;; which are already visible). The other, on P, will take you to a scratch
;; buffer with trident-mode enabled, creating the buffer if necessary.

;; Speaking of the scratch buffer, the trident-scratch command will take you
;; straight there.

;; ** Still do be done

;;    - Add some tests.
;;    - Better documentation.
;;    - Look into adding a REPL.
;;    - See if more integration with SLIME is possible.
;;    - Command(s) for compiling to a file.
;;    - Similar support for CL-WHO and/or CSS-LITE?
;;    - Add support for Customize.

;; ** Contributing

;; Contributions are very welcome. Since I've just started working on this and
;; don't have everything figured out yet, please first contact me on GitHub or
;; send me an email so we can talk before you start working on something.
